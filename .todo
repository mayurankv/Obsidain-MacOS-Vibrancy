Problems:
	Popout Windows:
		☐ How to access on plugin load to iterate through all
		☐ Setting `setVibrancy` doesn't appear to work
			☐ https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/30993

	To Develop:
		☐ Plugin should set opacities for different sections based on user settings

	Changing Focus Vibrancy Effecs:
		☐ Waiting on upstream changes to set at runtime or default Obsidian setting
			☐ https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/25513
			☐ https://forum.obsidian.md/t/option-for-when-macos-vibrancy-is-active/76188
		☐ // win.visualEffectState = "active";
